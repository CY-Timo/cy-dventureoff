DESCRIPTION:


YOU: Well, before we begin, I must say you are an incredibly enchanting tutor. Your wisdom and grace are captivating. How about we forget about the training and spend some time together?

Gromuald Grignon: chuckles Ah, young hero, you possess charm and audacity. However, our focus must remain on your training. The path ahead is filled with challenges, and your skills will be tested. I cannot be swayed by mere flattery.

YOU: Haha, fair enough, wise one. I suppose I'll have to rely on my own skills. But before we start, could you at least share some advice or a fascinating story with me?

Gromuald Grignon: Very well, my persistent hero. Listen closely. In this realm of nature and magic, appearances can be deceiving. Do not be fooled by the tranquil beauty that surrounds you. There may be hidden dangers lurking in every shadow. Trust your instincts, and remember that true strength comes not only from physical prowess but also from understanding the intricate balance of the world around you.

YOU: Thank you for the advice, tutor. I appreciate your wisdom.

Gromuald Grignon: Before you continue on your journey, let me share a brief tale of the ancient dragon that resides within these lands. This dragon, known as Paul Achedé, was born from the very essence of magic itself. With scales as iridescent as moonlight, Paul Achedé possessed immense power and wisdom. Long ago, it sought to protect the delicate harmony of nature, becoming both a guardian and a formidable force. But beware, for Paul Achedé's wrath can be unleashed if the balance is disrupted.

YOU (you suck lol): So, my path leads me to face this majestic dragon?

Gromuald Grignon: Indeed, young hero. It is your destiny to face Paul Achedé, but remember that strength alone will not suffice. Harness the power of nature and magic, and let your heart guide your actions. Only then will you have a chance to restore equilibrium and bring peace to these lands.

Hero: Thank you, tutor. I will embrace the challenges ahead and strive to be a worthy champion of nature and magic.

With Gromuald's advice echoing in his mind, the hero set forth on his journey, determined to face the trials that awaited him and to confront the mighty dragon, Paul Achedé. Though his attempt at seduction may have failed, he understood that true power came from within, and he would need all his skills and wisdom to succeed in his quest.
