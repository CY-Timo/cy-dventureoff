DESCRIPTION:

As the hero and leopard made their way through the dense forest, a sense of anticipation filled the air, fueling the hero's newly acquired confidence and determination. They could feel the weight of their objective and the imminent challenges ahead.

Suddenly, a terrifying roar echoed through the surrounding sinister ruins, chilling the blood of the hero and his companion. The ground shook beneath their feet, heralding the arrival of a colossal figure. Emerging from the darkness was Krrraan Shhhh, a cryptic creature known for his milimetered fighting technique and his goggles that blind those who disobey him.

With his frightening size and rectangular eyes, Krrraan Shhhh stood in front of the hero, blocking their path. His eyes burned with hate-filled fury. This was the final exercise in the hero's training.

Without hesitation, the hero climbed down from the leopard's back, ready to face his first test. The sky was overcast and the birds had stopped singing.
